README:

1. There's a file in the root directory of the gui-dev branch on GitHub called latent_gui_env - this has the list of conda packages needed to run the GUI and matcher.

2. To run the GUI, go to the root directory of the project (LatentAFIS/) and run with:
	python -m GUI/LatentMatcher_GUI
